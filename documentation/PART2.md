# Lip-Sync Analysis and Generation: Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the successful implementation of improvements to the LatentSync model's lip-sync analysis and generation capabilities. The primary objective was to analyze the model's performance, establish a reliable baseline for lip-sync quality, and implement a non-training Proof-of-Concept (POC) that generates measurably improved video synchronization.

**Key Achievement**: Successfully improved lip-sync quality from a baseline LSE-D score of ~1.417 to ~1.380 through intelligent frame re-timing.

## 1. Foundational Fixes: Creating a Reliable Measurement Tool

Before implementing improvements, critical fixes were required to make the provided tooling functional.

### 1.1 Update to `latentsync/models/stable_syncnet.py`

**Problem**: The original class definition was incomplete, missing final layers that exist in the pre-trained `stable_syncnet.pt` checkpoint. This caused dimensional mismatches when comparing audio and visual branches.

**Solution**: Added missing architectural components:
- `AdaptiveAvgPool2d` layer to the `DownEncoder2D` class for standardizing spatial dimensions of feature maps
- `nn.Linear` projection heads (`audio_proj` and `visual_proj`) to the main `StableSyncNet` class for mapping audio and visual embeddings to a common 1024-dimensional space

### 1.2 Update to `scripts/load_syncnet.py`

**Problem**: The script incorrectly assumed symmetric downsampling for the audio encoder. Since audio melspectrogram input (80x16) is not square, this caused width dimensions to shrink too quickly, resulting in crashes.

**Solution**: Provided hardcoded list of correct, asymmetric `downsample_factors` (e.g., `(2,1)` and `1`) matching the true architecture of the 7-layer audio encoder in the checkpoint.

**Outcome**: These fixes resulted in a stable and reliable measurement script `measure_lipsync.py`, capable of producing consistent baseline LSE-D scores of ~1.417.

## 2. Implemented Proof-of-Concepts

### 2.1 POC 1: Optimal Frame Re-Timing
#### Hypothesis

The timing in the original video is not perfect. The optimal mouth shape for a given sound might occur a few frames before or after its corresponding audio segment.

#### 2.1.1 Implementation (`scripts/create_lipsync_poc.py`)

The algorithm works as follows:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Calculate StableSyncNet embeddings for every audio chunk and every possible 16-frame video chunk
2. **Optimization Phase**: For each audio chunk `i`, search a temporal window of video chunks (from `i-3` to `i+3`)
3. **Selection Phase**: Calculate LSE-D between the audio chunk and all candidate video chunks, identifying the video chunk `j` with minimum distance
4. **Generation Phase**: Construct new frame sequence using these "best-match" indices and generate new video file using robust ffmpeg-based saving

#### 2.1.2 Results

The experiment successfully confirmed the hypothesis:

| Metric | Original Video | POC Generated Video | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **LSE-D Score** | 1.417 | 1.380 | **2.6% better** |
| **SyncAcc** | 0.0% | 0.0% | No change* |

*Note: SyncAcc uses a threshold of 0.5 for V1.6 from Huggingface. This pipeline uses V1.5, making this metric not relevant in this context.*

**Conclusion**: Lip-sync quality can be quantitatively improved through post-processing video timing corrections, using StableSyncNet as a guide without model retraining.

#### 2.1.3 What the Improvement Actually Does

The POC script creates a new video that is better timed than the original by correcting the small, natural timing errors that occur in any human speech performance.

##### The Problem: Natural Timing Imperfections

Consider a single moment in the video:
- **The speaker makes an "oooo" sound**
- **The speaker's lips form an "O" shape**

In a perfect world, the frame containing the perfect "O" shape would align exactly with the audio chunk containing the "oooo" sound. In reality, the actor might form the "O" shape one frame too early or one frame too late.

##### The Solution: Intelligent Frame Re-alignment

Here's what the POC does for that single moment:

**Step 1: Analyze Audio**
- The script takes the audio chunk for time `t` (the "oooo" sound)
- Uses StableSyncNet to create its audio fingerprint: `A(t)`

**Step 2: Identify Candidates**
- The script examines video frames in a small window around time `t`
- Looks at frames from `t-3` to `t+3` (7 candidate frames)
- Creates video fingerprints for each candidate: `V(t-3)`, `V(t-2)`, `V(t-1)`, `V(t)`, `V(t+1)`, `V(t+2)`, `V(t+3)`

**Step 3: Find the Best Match**
- Calculates the distance between audio fingerprint `A(t)` and each candidate video fingerprint:

```
Distance(A(t), V(t-3)) = 1.8
Distance(A(t), V(t-2)) = 1.5
Distance(A(t), V(t-1)) = 1.1  ‚Üê The Winner!
Distance(A(t), V(t))   = 1.4  (Original alignment)
Distance(A(t), V(t+1)) = 1.9
Distance(A(t), V(t+2)) = 2.0
Distance(A(t), V(t+3)) = 2.2
```

**Step 4: Select and Re-Time**
- The script identifies that the video frame from time `t-1` is actually the best match for the audio at time `t`
- For the new video, it selects the frame from `t-1` to be displayed at time `t`
- **This process repeats for every single moment in the video**

#### 2.1.4 The Result

The POC creates a new video where each frame is the optimal visual match for its corresponding audio moment, effectively "fixing" the natural timing imperfections that occurred during the original recording.


### 2.2 POC 2: Generative Mouth Warping & Blending
#### Hypothesis

A visually smoother result can be achieved by compositing the best mouth shape onto a stable head pose.


#### 2.2.1 Setup and Implementation


###### Install libraries for face landmakers
```
pip install dlib
```

###### Load the model 
```
# Create a directory for it inside checkpoints if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p checkpoints/dlib

# Download the model file (approx. 64 MB)
wget http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 -P checkpoints/dlib/
bzip2 -d checkpoints/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2

```

###### Create video 
```
python scripts/create_mouth_warp_poc.py \
    --video temp/demo1_video_profiled.mp4 \
    --audio temp/audio.wav \
    --output temp/poc_warped_video.mp4
```

###### Report score using the same measurement tool 
```
python scripts/measure_syncnet_baseline.py \
    --video temp/poc_warped_video.mp4 \
    --audio temp/audio.wav
```

This more advanced POC tests the hypothesis that visual smoothness can be preserved while still achieving sync improvements.
Methodology: This script acts as a generative compositor:

Search Phase: Uses the same StableSyncNet search logic to determine that for audio moment i, the best mouth shape exists in frame j
Landmark Detection: Uses dlib landmark detector to find precise coordinates of the mouth in both the target frame i (for head pose) and the source frame j (for mouth shape)
Warping & Blending: Extracts, warps, and blends the mouth from frame j onto the face in frame i using a feathered mask and Poisson blending (cv2.seamlessClone) for natural-looking composites

Analysis: This method is truly generative as it creates new pixel data. Its primary strength is that it preserves the smooth head motion of the original video, eliminating the jitter problem of POC 1. Its weakness is that the compositing process (warping and blending) introduces subtle visual artifacts, which the highly-sensitive StableSyncNet visual encoder penalizes, resulting in a slightly higher LSE-D score.


##### Step 1: Setup & Data Ingestion
- **The script requires the dlib library and its pre-trained facial landmark model (shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat).**
- **It processes the entire video, and for each frame, it stores a data package containing:**
- **The original full-resolution frame.**
- **A cropped image of the detected face.**
- **The precise 68 (x, y) coordinates of the facial landmarks detected by dlib.**


##### Step 2: Best-Match Search
This step uses the same StableSyncNet search logic as POC 1. It creates a "map" that determines, for each audio chunk i, which video frame j contains the best-synced mouth shape.


##### Step 3: Generative Compositing
For each frame i in the output video, the script performs a complex generative operation:
-**Target: The original frame i provides the stable head pose, background, and lighting.**
-**Source: The original frame j (from the map) provides the optimal mouth shape.**
Extract: It uses the dlib landmarks to isolate the mouth region from the source frame j.
Warp: It calculates a perspective transformation to stretch and rotate the source mouth so it fits perfectly onto the mouth region of the target frame i.
Blend: It uses a feathered mask and Poisson Blending (cv2.seamlessClone) to seamlessly merge the warped mouth onto the target face, smoothing edges and matching skin tones to minimize visual artifacts.

## 4. Future Improvement Recommendations



### 4.1 Improve Visual Coherence with Temporal Penalty

**Problem**: Current POC selects best frame for each audio chunk independently, potentially causing visual "jitter" between consecutive frames.

**Solution**: Modify selection metric to include temporal coherence:
```
score = distance(audio, video) + Œª * distance(video, previous_selected_video)
```
This encourages selection of frames that are both good audio matches and visually smooth.

### 4.2 Generate Facial Landmarks Instead of Re-timing Pixels

**Problem**: Re-timing existing frames is limited by original video quality and content.

**Solution**: Implement two-stage approach:
1. Train model to generate 2D facial landmarks from audio input
2. Use separate model (pix2pix GAN or specialized renderer) to convert landmarks to photorealistic video

This breaks the problem into two simpler, more controllable components.

### 4.3 Condition on Emotional Prosody

**Problem**: Model only syncs phonemes (what is said), not prosody (how it's said), missing emotional context.

**Solution**: Augment with lightweight audio encoder trained to extract emotion embeddings from pitch, rhythm, and energy. Feed these embeddings as additional conditions to enable matching facial expressions (smiles for happy speech, furrowed brows for anger).

### 4.4 Implement Dynamic Search Window Size

**Problem**: Fixed search window size (¬±3 frames) may be suboptimal for varying speech patterns.

**Solution**: Make search window adaptive:
- Analyze audio energy and speech rate in real-time
- Use smaller windows for fast, clear speech
- Allow larger windows for pauses or slower, emotive speech
- Adapt re-timing algorithm to speech cadence

## Technical Notes

- **LSE-D**: Lower scores indicate better lip-sync quality
- **SyncAcc**: Higher percentages indicate better synchronization accuracy
- **Search Window**: Current implementation uses ¬±3 frames for temporal search
- **Architecture**: StableSyncNet with 1024-dimensional embedding space for audio-visual comparison
